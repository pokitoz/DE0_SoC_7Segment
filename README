7 Segments
==========

DE0 Nano SoC: 5csema4u23c6

System contains
	Nios II/e processor
	128kB on-chip memory
	JTAG UART

Documentation of the 6 digits 7 Segments extension for the DE0 Nano SoC can be found on this github

The main signal for configuring this board can be found here:
	SelSeg(7 downto 0)  selects the which of the 7 segments: Active-high
	nSelDig(5 downto 0) selects which of the 6 displays is selected: Active-low
	Reset_Led           discharge all the capacitors (reset the display): Active-high

The TCL script contains the pin assigment used.
Tools > Tcl Scripts > pin_assignment_DE0_Nano_SoC_7_segment_extension.tcl > Run

Please generate the Qsys system before compiling. Or add .qsys instead of .qpi inside the quartus project

To program the FPGA:
Programer:
        > Hardware Setup... > Select the hardware
        > Auto Detect > Select Device > 5CSEMA4
        
For device 5CSEMA4, Add File... and select .sof file generated (should be in 'output_files' folder)
Check box "Program/Configure"

The extension should be plugged on GPIO1
